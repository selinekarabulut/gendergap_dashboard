# Gender Disparity in Political Party Leadership

As part of my dissertation research, I compiled a dataset covering political party leaders in 103 democracies worldwide from 1980 to 2018. This dataset allowed me to explore whether political party leadership is similarly dominated by men, as seen in other leadership roles.
To make it more accessible, I created an app using python streamlit framework (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) where people can explore the data on their own.

For a deeper exploration of the data, you can access the app through this link: Gender Gap Political Party Leadership App (https://gendergappoliticalpartyleadership.streamlit.app). Each visualization is designed to illustrate the percentage of women who assumed the role of political party leaders in each selected year, rather than the percentage of women among all political party leaders in each selected year.

From 1980 to 2018, there were a total of 3,774 instances of individuals holding the position of party leader. Among them, 481 were women, while 3,293 were men. This translates to only 12.7% of party leaders being women during this period across 103 democratic countries, signaling a significant gender disparity among the highest-ranking members of party structures.

Feel free to explore the appâ€™s GitHub repository, which aims to visually show this gender gap in political party leadership, and read the relevant medium post (https://medium.com/@SelinKarabulut/gender-disparity-in-political-party-leadership-400215e713ef). Hopefully, this data will contribute to constructive discussions on formulating targeted policies to address this persistent issue.
