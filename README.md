# Gender Disparity in Political Party Leadership

As part of my dissertation research, I compiled a dataset covering political party leaders in 103 democracies worldwide from 1980 to 2018. This dataset allowed me to explore whether political party leadership is similarly dominated by men, as seen in other leadership roles.
To make it more accessible, I created an app using python streamlit framework (https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) where people can explore the data on their own.

For a deeper exploration of the data, you can access the app through this link: Gender Gap Political Party Leadership App (https://gendergappoliticalpartyleadership.streamlit.app). Each visualization is designed to illustrate the percentage of women who assumed the role of political party leaders in each selected year, rather than the percentage of women among all political party leaders in each selected year.

Taking a broader perspective, the pie chart below vividly illustrates the severity of the gender gap in political party leadership. The chart compares the number of female party leaders to male party leaders, providing compelling evidence of the profound gender disparity at the highest levels of party leadership.
